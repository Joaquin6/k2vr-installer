['02B0','02BB','02AE'] ID array for 360 Kinect
Main device (shows up driverless)
audio device needs power to show up
camera device signifies everything is working A-OK

02C4 ID for xbone kinect

seems in some cases, forcing kinect explorer to run will cause 360 kinect to behave and work in k2vr.


if driver4vr was installed previously then removed, theres a chance vrchat will ignore all controller input, if thats the case, reinstall the entire game to fix it. (thanks Kernel Panic)
